Alternative Datasets for CMC Drug‐Product Manufacturing Knowledge Graphs

Below are several datasets—both public and synthetic/in-house—that align with your expertise in Python, metadata management, FAIR principles, and bioinformatics pipelines. Each example includes how you might ingest, model, and link it within a knowledge graph for CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls) use cases.

1. Public Reference & Regulatory Datasets

NIST Reference Material Database
- Contents: Physicochemical properties (melting point, purity, solubility) of API reference standards.  
- Graph Use:  
  - Nodes: Materials, Properties, Units  
  - Edges: hasProperty, measuredIn  
- Integration Tip: Ingest as RDF via rdflib, align units to the QU ontology for semantic consistency.

FDA Pharma Quality Reporting System (PQRS)
- Contents: Manufacturing site inspections, product recalls, quality metrics.  
- Graph Use:  
  - Nodes: Sites, Products, InspectionEvents, ObservationMetrics  
  - Edges: inspectedAt, triggeredRecall, measures  
- Integration Tip: Use the OpenFDA API to pull JSON, transform into triples, and link site metadata (geolocation, audit history).

EMA Public Assessment Reports (EPAR)
- Contents: Manufacturing descriptions, process flowcharts, excipient lists for approved drugs in the EU.  
- Graph Use:  
  - Nodes: Drug, ProcessStep, Excipient, Equipment  
  - Edges: usesExcipient, follows, performedOn  
- Integration Tip: Parse PDF tables with tabula-py, map equipment names to a custom ontology (e.g., OBI for biological processes).

2. Chemical & Formulation Property Repositories

| Dataset                    | Key Fields                                 | Graph Modeling                              |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| ChEMBL                     | Compound structure, assay results          | Link API→Assay→Result; embed InChI as node   |
| PubChem Substance & Compound| Synonyms, SMILES, taxonomy                | Map synonyms via skos:altLabel; connect taxonomy hierarchy |
| USP Monograph Collection   | Monograph ID, assay methods, acceptance criteria | Nodes for Tests, Criteria, Materials; edges like hasMethod |

Integration Tip: Load CSV/TSV exports into Pandas, convert to RDF with pandas→rdflib pipelines, and store in a triple store for SPARQL queries.

3. In-House & Synthetic Manufacturing Data

1. Batch Record Sensor Time Series  
   - Data: Timestamped readings (temperature, pH, pressure) from reactors or bioreactors.  
   - Graph Use:  
     - Nodes: Batch, Sensor, Reading, ParameterThreshold  
     - Edges: recordedAt, exceedsThreshold  
   - Pipeline:  
     - Python scripts with argparse to ingest CSV logs.  
     - Extract events where readings drift outside spec; annotate as alerts in the graph.

2. Stability Study Logs  
   - Data: Timepoint, storage conditions, assay results (potency, impurity).  
   - Graph Use:  
     - Nodes: Sample, Timepoint, Condition, AssayResult  
     - Edges: storedUnder, testedAt, resultedIn  
   - Pipeline:  
     - Jupyter notebook using Papermill parameters for different formulations  
     - Automate comparison of impurity profiles across timepoints.

3. Excipient Supplier & Certificate of Analysis (CoA) Metadata  
   - Data: Supplier name, batch number, CoA attributes (water content, microbial limits).  
   - Graph Use:  
     - Nodes: Supplier, ExcipientBatch, QualityAttribute  
     - Edges: supplies, definesAttribute  
   - Pipeline:  
     - Use SQLAlchemy to pull from vendor databases, normalize tables, and push triples.

4. Linking Across Datasets

- Raw Material → Process Parameter: Connect excipient batches from CoA to specific process steps in PQRS data.  
- Analytical Results → Stability Outcomes: Bridge assay triples from USP Monographs to in-house stability results.  
- Regulatory Events → Manufacturing Records: Link recall events in PQRS to sensor anomalies in batch logs.

Next Steps & Divergent Ideas

- Ontology Alignment: Map your domain terms to existing standards (e.g., OBI, BFO, PROV-O) to enhance interoperability.  
- Graph Database: Load triples into Neo4j using neosemantics and leverage Cypher for complex queries (e.g., find all batches at risk of stability failure).  
- Graph ML: Apply embedding libraries (StellarGraph, PyTorch Geometric) on your CMC graph to predict process anomalies or optimal formulation parameters.  
- Automated Reporting: Extend your Airflow+Papermill pipeline to serialize output graphs into interactive dashboards (Plotly Dash or Streamlit).  
- FAIR Compliance: Package your datasets and metadata with DataCite DOIs, use YAML/JSON-LD for dataset descriptors, and expose SPARQL endpoints for broader consumption.

Which of these resonates most with your current roadmap? I can help you deep-dive into any of these pipelines or tools next.
